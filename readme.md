## Assignment Overview
What is the assignment about?  
Explain the purpose of the program and what it accomplishes.

This assignment is to write a C program that works with a graph stored as an adjacency matrix in a .txt file. The program should show a menu with options to display the graph as an adjacency list, do Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from vertex 1, and find the shortest paths from vertex 1 using Dijkstra's algorithm. The program must use linked lists and follow proper coding and documentation rules.
